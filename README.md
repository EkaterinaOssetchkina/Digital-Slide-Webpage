# Digital Slide Webpage - University of Toronto, 2021

This is open-source code was prepared to help view thin section images online, including the ability to switch through channels, have a slider overlay between channels and zoom-in/out of the image, much like a microscope could do.

The webpage is published online at: http://individual.utoronto.ca/digital_slide/

With the code shared here, lines *8, 40, 498* through *523* can be updated to your images, and you can repurpose the digital thin section for your work.
This tool is a standalone application developed by Ekaterina (Katia) Ossetchkina, 2021. This digital thin-section was created as an educational tool, part of the paper ```Tapas de sílice – a smörgåsbord of reactive mineralogies and textures```, 2021, authored by Lucas Herzog Bromerchenkel, Oleksiy Chernoloz, Pengfei Zhao, Ekaterina Ossetchkina, and Dr. Karl Peterson.

The sample images shared in this code are the Tapas Silice sand, same as in the original publication.
